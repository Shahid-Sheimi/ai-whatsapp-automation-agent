# Building an AI Agentic Workflow for Postal Services with WhatsApp, PostgreSQL, Qdrant, Langfuse, FastAPI

## 📌 Overview
Postal services handle countless inquiries daily—tracking packages, updating user details, and resolving lost package issues. To explore how AI can automate these tasks, this project introduces an **agentic workflow** that makes real-time decisions based on user requests, reducing the burden on call centers and eliminating the frustrations of traditional chatbots.

This system was built **without relying on any frameworks**, using **pure Python**, making it highly flexible and lightweight.
